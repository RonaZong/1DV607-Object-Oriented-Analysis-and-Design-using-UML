Your implementation is a bit advanced for me, I can only review it based on the requirements.
Tbh I learned a lot from your work. Thank you!

The documentation is very clear, easy to follow.
Class diagram uses correct notation and layout. If it is suitable for your implementation and logic, you can add multiplicity.
Sequence digrams use correct notation and layout.
Indentation and formatting of blocks is correct and consequent.
Naming of classes/operations/attributes and arguments are consequent and use real words.
The code is generally readable and understandable.
Comments are readable and in English.

It contains one UML class diagram and two sequence diagrams(one for input and one for output).
It contains the source code of the application.
It contains an executable version alternatively instruction on how to run the system.
I can run the system.
All requirements are working in the running system.

There is a strict model-view seperation, no printing or display of information in the model. No formating of strings for printouts in the model.
The design and implementation is object oriented.
The design artifacts are in sync with the code.
